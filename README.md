## Student Performance Data Visualization Project


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic data visualization techniques in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. We explored a real-world dataset containing students' performance scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, alongside demographic information such as gender and parental education level.

The visualizations were created to help identify patterns, relationships, and distributions within the dataset.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
âœ… Create a basic line plot and scatter plot using Matplotlib

âœ… Visualize data distributions using histograms and box plots with Seaborn

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Name: StudentsPerformance.csv

Description: Contains student test scores and demographic details

Source: Kaggle â€” Student Performance Data 

ðŸ“Š Visualizations Created
Line Plot: Math scores trend for the first 50 students

Scatter Plot: Relationship between Math and Reading scores

Histogram: Distribution of Writing scores

Box Plot: Distribution of Math scores by Gender
